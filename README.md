# Project: Modern Fluid Layout Website with Light/Dark Theme

## Description
This is a modern website built with a **fluid layout** — no media queries, no CSS Grid. The design is fully flexible and adapts to any screen size naturally using percentage-based widths and logical CSS properties. The site also supports light and dark themes that users can toggle on demand.

## Technologies
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** — for clean and semantic structure.
- **SCSS** — for maintainable and scalable styles.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — for interactive features like theme switching.
- **Logical CSS Properties** — such as `margin-inline`, `padding-block`, and `inset-inline` to ensure better support for different writing directions.
- **Fluid Layout** — built without media queries or CSS Grid; layout scales smoothly across all screen sizes using relative units like `%`, `em`, and `rem`.

## Features
- **No Media Queries**: The layout is entirely fluid and adapts to screen size without breakpoints.
- **No CSS Grid**: Layout relies on modern flexbox and logical properties for simplicity and adaptability.
- **Light and Dark Theme Support**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes, stored in `localStorage` for preference persistence.
- **Internationalization-Ready Layout**: Logical properties ensure better support for both LTR and RTL languages.
